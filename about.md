"Welcome to  _Exercises for the Mind_! If you're looking for ways to boost your productivity, cultivate a positive mindset, and live a more balanced life, you've come to the right place. I started this blog because I'm passionate about these topics, and I've been learning about them for a few years now.

Through book learning, Youtube binge-watching and discussions with friends, I've gathered quite a couple of useful tips that I would like to share with whoever wants to read it. Each week, I'll be posting a short blog post where I'll share a simple exercise or a snippet of information from material I have studied. My goal is to provide  simple exercises and actionable tips that you can easily incorporate into your daily routine.

So if you're ready to take your productivity, mindset, and balance to the next level, join us on this journey!" (And if you are more than ready, make sure to add it to your RSS feed!)

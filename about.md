"Welcome to  _Exercises for the Mind_! If you're looking for ways to boost your productivity, cultivate a positive mindset, and live a more balanced life, you've come to the right place. I started this blog because I'm passionate about these topics, and I've been studying and reflecting on them for a few years now.

Through my studies and discussions with a group of friends, I've learned that making small changes to your daily habits can have a big impact on your overall well-being. I believe that everyone can benefit from these insights, whether you're a student, professional, or just someone looking to improve your life.

On this blog, I share simple exercises, book snippets, and insights that have helped me and my friends on our journeys towards a more fulfilling life. My goal is to provide practical tips that you can apply to your own life, and to create a space where we can all learn and grow together.

So if you're ready to take your productivity, mindset, and balance to the next level, join us on this journey!" (And if you are more than ready, make sure to add it to your RSS feed!)

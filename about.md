# About

Welcome to _Exercises for the Mind_!

My name is Marie, and I have been studying and discussing books (and lots of youtube videos) about productivity, habit formation, mindset, and living a balanced life for a couple of years now. The topics have taught me lots of life hacks and new ways to look at  and sharing what I learn with others. That's why I created this blog - to share simple exercises and insights that can help you live your best life.

Each week, I'll be posting a new blog post where I'll share a simple exercise or a snippet on the topic of productivity, mindset, or balance. My goal is to provide actionable tips that you can easily incorporate into your daily routine.

Thank you for visiting _Exercises for the Mind_. I hope that the exercises and insights I share can help you on your journey to a more productive, balanced, and fulfilling life.

Good luck!

## Exercise
Your challenge is to not use the words 'have to' for a full day. Whenever you notice you want to use those words ask yourself the following questions: 
- Who makes it so I _'have to'_ do this? 
- Do I have a choice? If so, what choice do I have?
Additionally, try to rephrase what you were going to say without using 'have to'. Instead, use words like 'can', 'want', 'choose to' et cetera.

## Example
Suppose you have to go to work today. You do not feel like going to work. When someone asks you what you are up to today, you want to answer "I have to go to work in an hour", but you stop. Ask yourself: 'who makes it so that I have to go to work? Do I have a choice in this?' In a sense, you Ã¡re the reason you have to go to work. You could choose not to go to work. However, for reasons that are important to you you still choose to go. Perhaps you like your job, or you find it important to have a steady income? In either case, there are reasons that make you choose to go to work today, rather than stay at home. Thus you answer: "I want to go to work in an hour."

## Context
This is an exercise described in the book _Crazy Busy_ by Dutch psychologist Thijs Launspach. Leading up to this exercise he describes that people have different degrees to which they feel they are in control of their life. People who feel they are the owner of their own life have an internal attribution style: they generally attribute events in their life - good or bad - to their own acting. In contrast, people with an external attribution style tend to explain the cause of events in their life as something that happens outside of themselves. Someone, or something else was responsible for whatever happens to them. People generally adhere to a mix of both styles (apart from some outliers perhaps). 

Psychologist Launspach explains that people who heavily rely on the external attribution style suffer a bunch of negative consequences such as higher stress levels, feelings of helplessness, depression, lower rates of success and more fear. What type of attribution style a person relies on more heavily can be heard in the language they use. People who say they 'have to' do something express no control or choice over the event, while people who say they 'want to' do something express that they choose to do that something. 

The point of this exercise is to get comfortable with a more internal attribution style: the events that happen to you are a result of your doing. The author explains that _'fake it till you make it'_ is a good strategy for changing your attribution style. So good luck with your day of faking it!

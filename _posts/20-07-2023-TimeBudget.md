*Time famine* or *time poverty* has become a well-studied concept. The feeling of not having enough time to do all that you want to do. Even though the exercise presented here will not create more time for you, it may help to get insight into: (1) what you spend your time on; and (2) which portion of your time is freely available after you have slept, eaten, and done all required things. The exercise presented here is meant to motivate you to use the time you have left wisely. In this article we will briefly go through the **exercise**, an **example**, and the **context** in which I found this exercise.

Enjoy!

## Exercise
To determine the time you have available for activities you want to do, follow these steps:
1. Write down what you spend your time on throughout the week. Think of activities that are required such as sleeping, maintenance (cooking, cleaning, doing laundry et cetera) and work or study. If you are member of a sports or hobby club do not forget to include the time spent on this club as well.
2. Use a pie chart to visualize the distribution of your weekly time among different activities.
3. Subtract the time spent on these activities from the total of 168 hours a week.

The remaining hours represent the time available for pursuits such as meeting friends and family, pursuing a hobby you like.

## Example
When I did this exercise, I created the following pie chart:

The book from where this exercise came gives 56 hours of sleep and 32 hours of maintenance as an indication, which I thought was a good estimate. I study about 8 hours a day but have included travel time in that portion of the pie. Furthermore, I have about ten hours worth of planned social activities that come back every week. Lastly, I want to make sure I exercise at least 6 hours a week, so I have also allocated 6 hours to that activity. As you can see in the pie chart, this leaves me with $168 - (56 + 32 + 42 + 10 + 6) = 16$ hours for all other things that I want to do with my life. 

It is interesting to see that after all the required things are done I still have 16 hours of free time in my week that is all mine. That amounts to over two hours a day worth of time that I can spend however I like. An insight this gave me is that spending an hour a day on WhatsApp, which is my personal pitfall, already consumes about half of my free time. 

## Context
Thijs Launspach, the author of the book *Crazy Busy*, describes the exercise while discussing the amount of time we spend on social media. He argues that it helps to have a clear overview of your time, so you are better able to decide what is worth your time and what is not. It is meant to confront you with the number of freely available hours that you have during the week. It may act as a motivator for you to spend less time on draining activities like scrolling on the internet and more time with friends or doing something more fulfilling. Note that the author does argue it is important to spend time just unwinding and relaxing as well. So not all of your activities have to be meaningful and fulfilling, it is fine to slack every now and then :)
